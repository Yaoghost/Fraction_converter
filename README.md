# Fraction_converter
 The purpose of this code is to take a user-input floating-point number, determine whether it is an integer or a non-integer, and then display it either as a fraction or as the original integer.

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter a floating-point number.
2. It checks if the input number has a fractional part.
3. If the input has a fractional part:
   - The program calculates and displays the fractional representation.
4. If the input is an integer:
   - The program displays the integer value.
  
   - ## Note
- The program uses a tolerance of Â±0.001 to determine the fractional representation.

## Compatibility
- Developed and tested using a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.
